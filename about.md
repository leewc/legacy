This is the HTML5UP Theme Helios with Jekyll support added by me (Wen Chuan Lee). I will be making a release so it can be downloaded as a zip before I start customizing the entire site to suit my needs. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at: [github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

I'll set up a credits page soon, and more tutorials!
