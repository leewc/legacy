[leewc.com](https://leewc.com/) - A blog by Wen Chuan Lee ãƒ„
--- 

This is the GitHub Pages repository that hosts my Jekyll site at [leewc.com](https://leewc.com/), a personal blog on programming, software development, thoughts, and... food.

Website theme is [Helios](http://html5up.net/helios), which I have ported for Jekyll and added a ton of other features. Read more about the technologies used to build the site [here](https://leewc.com/site-meta/).

*Please let me know if there are any issues on the issues page*, if you're interested in grabbing a copy of the theme without my customizations check out the [Git Tags](https://github.com/leewc/leewc.github.io/releases) for all versions.

Original Theme Read Me:

	Helios by HTML5 UP
	html5up.net | @n33co
	Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


	This is Helios, a brand new site template for HTML5 UP. It's clean, modern, and designed
	to take advantage of larger (well, wider) displays while still being capable of gracefully
	scaling down to fit all manner of smaller ones.

	Demo images* courtesy of Michael Domaradzki, an awesome photographer I met over at
	deviantART. Check out his portfolio here:

	and/or use any of Michaels's work without his explicit permission!)
