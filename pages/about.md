I'm Wen Chuan Lee, currently a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 

I'm from Malaysia where it's easily over 32째C [89째F] and survived 2 cold winters (where it's usually -25째C [-13째F] on a good day)!

I speak 3 languages, English being my first language, Mandarin being my second one and then Bahasa Malaysia.

<s>I like taking long walks on the beach and watching Netflix on a lazy Sunday. </s> Oh, er, wrong about me there. 

Everyone wants to be a part of something big, and I'm not ashamed to say that I too, would want to **be a part of** something big, or **start** something big. 

Think that pretty much fits the bill for an about me page.

Ah, yes, I'm also more of a practical person. While I like to dream, I find myself considering how practical something is. If it's not pragmatic, it doesn't mean that I won't work on it, but I'll approach it in a practical way. Of course this doesn't stop me from being optimistic and hopeful about new things, it's just that my perspective comes with a hint of skepticism as to how things will work out. 

Check me out on StackOverflow, GitHub and Twitter in the links below! (if you want to, that is.)

Also, my [resume](/resume/) for a more professional look on what I've been up to. 

Thanks again for dropping by!
