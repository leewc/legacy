I'm Lee, currently a senior studying *Computer Science* at the **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**. Ergo, I'm currently located in Minneapolis.

Well, I usually go by my last name as my first name, because Wen Chuan Lee isn't the easiest name to pronounce, and it's a common occurrence people think 'Chuan' is my middle name which gets truncated to Wen Lee. Not that there's anything wrong with that name, but I definitely prefer just 'Lee' over the single 'Wen'. 

I'm from originally **Malaysia** where it's easily over 32°C [89°F] and survived 2 cold winters here in Minnesota where it's usually -25°C [-13°F]. The only other time I've seen snow was this one time in Korea. At this rate I've seen and lived with enough snow for a lifetime. I am also 8981 miles away (14453.5 kilometers for us metric people) from home.

I speak 3 languages, English being my first language, Mandarin being my second one and then Bahasa Malaysia. I also know other languages.

<span  markdown="0"><s>I like taking long walks on the beach and watching Netflix on a lazy Sunday. I'm a hopeless romantic</s> Oh, er, wrong about me there. </span>

Everyone wants to be a part of something big, and I'm not ashamed to say that I too, would want to **be a part of** something big, or **start** something big.

Though I am familiar that the generation I'm a part of [are probably unhappy](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html) due to this fixation on thinking we're all special and unique, doesn't mean we all can't dream.  

Although, I'm also more of a practical person. While I do dream, I find myself considering how practical something is. If it's not pragmatic, it doesn't mean that I won't work on it, but I'll approach it in a **practical** way. Of course this doesn't stop me from being optimistic and hopeful about new things, it's just that my perspective comes with a hint of skepticism as to how things will work out. Probably one of the reasons why I feel more fulfilled when I see the results of me hunched over a laptop for hours come together (*hopefully*), elegant or not. 

Think that pretty much fits the bill for an about me page. At least in professional/blogger kind of way. 

Although you won't always catch me saying this with dripping enthusiasm, I look forward to what life will bring me, at least I try to tell myself that. Oh, I also like photography although I haven't devoted enough time and effort in fully exploring that path. The background photo on this website was shot by me at Sausalito during my trip in California. Image metadata tells me it was taken at coordinates (37°50'59.1"N 122°28'47.7"W). 

**Perhaps I forget this at times**, but on a more abstract scale what I want to do in Computer Science is to make a difference, and help people solve problems. Maybe it's the same kick I get when being able to help someone understand things better, on StackOverflow or in real life. To have made a difference in software that positively impacts another person's life.    

Check me out on [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/users/4512948/matrixanomaly), and follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/wenchuanlee) if you're interested. ☺

Also, my [resume](/resume/) for a more professional look on what I've been up to. 

Thanks again for dropping by!
