I'm Lee, currently a senior studying *Computer Science* at the **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**.

Everyone wants to be a part of something big, and I'm not ashamed to say that I too, would want to **be a part of** something big, or **start** something big.

Though I am familiar that the generation I'm a part of [are probably unhappy](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html) due to this fixation on thinking we're all special and unique, doesn't mean we all can't dream.  

Although, I'm also more of a practical person. While I do dream, I find myself considering how practical something is. If it's not pragmatic, it doesn't mean that I won't work on it, but I'll approach it in a **practical** way. Of course this doesn't stop me from being optimistic and hopeful about new things, it's just that my perspective comes with a hint of skepticism as to how things will work out. Probably one of the reasons why I feel more fulfilled when I see the results of me hunched over a laptop for hours come together (*hopefully*), elegant or not. 

Think that pretty much fits the bill for an about me page. At least in professional/blogger kind of way. 

Although you won't always catch me saying this with dripping enthusiasm, I look forward to what life will bring me, at least I try to tell myself that. Oh, I also like photography although I haven't devoted enough time and effort in fully exploring that path. The background photo on this website was shot by me at Sausalito during my trip in California. Image metadata tells me it was taken at coordinates (37°50'59.1"N 122°28'47.7"W). 

**Perhaps I forget this at times**, but on a more abstract scale what I want to do in Computer Science is to make a difference, and help people solve problems. Maybe it's the same kick I get when being able to help someone understand things better, on StackOverflow or in real life. To have made a difference in software that positively impacts another person's life.
