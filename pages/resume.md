## Education  
<br />

### Bachelor of Science, Computer Science
**University of Minnesota - Twin Cities**
College of Science and Engineering
Senior, Class of 2016
CGPA: 3.30

------

## Skills  
<br /> 

I'm experienced with C# and Java in a professional environment, fluent in Python, OCaml and C++. Varied and less experience with other languages such as C, XAML (Microsoft's eXtensible Application Markup Language on WPF), VB.NET, SQL, Assembly, HTML5, CSS but I know my way around good enough.

Currently dabbling in web languages like JavaScript, and SASS (a superset of CSS) as well as looking at all the awesome web frameworks.

Technologies I've worked with include Windows Presentation Foundation, COM/DCOM, VMware Virtualization software, Git, Team Foundation Server, Visual Source Safe, MSSQL, PostgreSQL and InstallShield. Take a look at my [Projects page](/projects/) for a few projects I've worked on.

## Work Experience    
<br />

### Co-op Intern in Software Engineering
**Emerson Process Management**
Eden Prairie, Minnesota
January 2015 - Present 

**What I've done:**
- Written C# software to create a simulated network using customer's MSSQL database backup, development includes using XAML/WPF to create a simple UI, multi-threading to avoid UI thread from locking, parsing device data and fetching complete device data using XML, and the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) for loose coupling between each solution. LINQ was also used to extract information from the database and handling the XML data.
- Upgrade legacy installers (from the VB6 days) to ensure newer versions of Windows can install the utility.
- Maintain and write Unit Test Plans (UTP) and Software Design Documents (SDD) which are formally reviewed.

**What I've learnt:**
- *To learn* by understanding a problem first and use references online and the documentation, as well as some guidance from my mentor who has given me a more self-driven environment to learn and work in.
- To use multiple Virtual Machines during development of software because it's much easier starting fresh in a VM than having to reformat constantly.
- COM/DCOM is painful stuff but still very much necessary and relevant.
- To handle code written by 3 other previous interns, which might have bugs and lack of comments.
- Read and understand thousands of lines of code to make necessary changes. 
- Branching and shelvesets in TFS.

### Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
**University of Minnesota - Twin Cities**
January 2014 - January 2015
**Classes I've TA-ed for are:** Introduction to Computer Science (for non-majors),  Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures
**What I've done:**	Grade, supervise and proctor homeworks and examinations, as well as carry out practical labs and hold office hours. All that and responding to emails and forum posts on assignments, usually they come flooding in the last few hours before the due date. 
**What I've learnt:** How to communicate better, especially to others who might or might not have a technical background, as well as further understand data structures (because you can't teach something without having a more in-depth understanding of said thing)
<br />

### Student Technical Support 
**Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota**
March 2014 - June 2014
**What I've done:**
- Respond to issues and requests by MSI Users via multiple communication channels. 
- Guide and simplify explanations for non-technical MSI Users.
- Carry out off-site tape backups, systems monitoring and inventory keeping.
- Some experience with technologies such as Sputnik, Puppet, Jenkins and RT in routine work.

**What I've learnt:**
- How to communicate with customers in a professional matter
- A ton of SSH (seriously a good feeling tunneling into a supercomputer)
- Seen how VMs and servers run behind the scenes.
- Dabbled into what Splunk, Jenkins, Puppet do and keep the whole system up and running.
- Performed tape backups on a supercomputer. 
- How to properly escalate issues and using the RT system to handle support tickets.

## Other Activities
<br />

### Presenter for the USApps Workshop
**Taylor's University**
Klang Valley, Malaysia
July & August 2013 and 2014
- USAPPS is non-profit organization by a large team of Malaysian students who study abroad in the United States, where we provide 2 workshops to educate younger students about studying and life in the US, as well as dwell into aspects of the application, essay writing, education pathway, scholarships, and more. I was a part of this group of people who just volunteered and dedicated time off to come together and inspire students about studying in the United States. It is literally *by the students, for the students.*
- I was fortunate enough for an opportunity to be give 40 minute talk about US education pathways with another friend to the workshop attendees (over 200 students). The workshop was a great success and I met many amazing people along the way. If you're in Malaysia and have friend or younger siblings that are considering studying in the United States but don't have a clue about anything (or just want to meet helpful people) head on over to our [website](http://www.usapps.org/)!
<br />

### Project Leader for CSE Expo
**University of Minnesota - Twin Cities**
- Independently designed and received funding for showcasing 2 hands-on projects (Banana Keyboard and build your own Raspberry Pi laptop) to encourage children from multiple schools to be involved with STEM fields.
<br />

### Transfer Peer Guide
**University of Minnesota - Twin Cities**
- I was in charge of showing students who have transferred to the university from other states and countries how to be accustomed and a part of the universities big and diverse groups. Aside from checking in with them on a monthly basis and providing advice, peer guides were tasked with pointing the new transfers to the right resources and where to get help on common transfer student issues.
